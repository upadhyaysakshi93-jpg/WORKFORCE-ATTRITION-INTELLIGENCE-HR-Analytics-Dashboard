# WORKFORCE-ATTRITION-INTELLIGENCE-HR-Analytics-Dashboard
By: Sakshi Upadhyay

# 📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is not just an HR metric — it is a compounding financial loss.
This end-to-end analytics project identifies workforce attrition patterns, quantifies business impact, and builds a strategic retention framework backed by data-driven insights.

# 🎯 Business Problem & Objective

The organization is experiencing 16.12% attrition, resulting in talent leakage, skill-gap instability, and onboarding resource wastage.
Replacing an employee is expensive — when aggregated, this translates into an estimated annual replacement loss of ₹6.81 Million.

Primary Objective:
Identify the top drivers causing employee churn and convert insights into actionable, cost-saving strategies — instead of generic HR policy changes.

# 📊 Dataset Understanding

Total Employees Analyzed: 1470

Total Attrition Count: 237

Target Variable: Attrition (Yes/No)

Dataset Attributes: 35+ features covering job role, demographics, compensation, experience, and satisfaction levels.

# 🧰 Tools & Tech Stack Used

-- Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing	Excel  
-- KPI Derivation & Segmentation	MySQL (SQL Queries)  
-- Visualization & Storytelling	Power BI (DAX Measures) 

This demonstrates a complete real analyst workflow — cleaning → analyzing → visualizing → concluding.

# 🔁 Methodology Flow

-- Cleaned raw dataset in Excel (removed redundant data, structured schema)  
-- Loaded processed dataset into MySQL and extracted KPIs using SQL  
-- Imported into Power BI to model, segment, and visualize insights  
-- Built final decision dashboard → connecting HR data to financial impact  

# 📌 KPI Summary :
-- Attrition Rate	16.12%	Workforce leakage health indicator  
-- Attrition Count	237 exits	Actual employee churn volume  
-- Attrition Cost Impact	₹6.81 Million/year	Estimated annual replacement loss. Reducing attrition by 10% saves ~₹681k annually.  
-- Overtime Attrition	127 (Yes) vs 110 (No)	Workload stress strongly correlates with exits  

# 🔍 Key Insight Narratives

## Driver	Insight
-- Job Role	Sales Representatives show the highest churn (39.76%) → major productivity drain  
-- Tenure	First-year exits extremely high (36.36%) → onboarding quality needs overhaul  
-- Salary Band	Low salary band attrition (21.76%) is almost 2x of high salary band → compensation dissatisfaction  
-- Age Band	Under age 25 attrition (39.18%) → younger workforce struggles with stability & role attachment  
-- Department	R&D attrition (56.12%) = most expensive skill loss segment  
-- Distance	Attrition spikes for employees with commute 15–20 km (25.64%) → commute friction matters  

# ✅ Strategic Recommendations

-- Apply selective 8–12% salary uplift only for low band segments (not universal)  
-- Implement structured onboarding & mentoring program for first-year employees  
-- Re-design workload allocation to reduce overtime stress  
-- Prioritize retention in Sales & R&D roles due to highest ROI impact  

# 🧾 Conclusion

Attrition here is predictable and preventable.
By targeting a few specific drivers (Sales role, salary band, early tenure, commute friction, R&D segment), the organization can reduce attrition by 8–12% and unlock annual cost savings of ₹681,000+.


# 🚀 Future Scope

-- Add machine learning model to predict future churn probability  
-- Enable automated monthly attrition tracking & alert based insights  
-- Add market salary benchmarking for smarter compensation design  
-- Build scenario simulations (e.g., salary uplift effect forecasting)
